# Code Literacy: Fluency in conversations of science

##  *What I research...*
  
As many of you know, Tom is my advisor and in our lab we are focused on population genetics.  

Fundamentally, population genetics is understanding the genetic variation within and between populations of a species and how the composition of these species is changing through time.
From this starting point, we can answer all sorts of interesting evolutionary questions, which for myself look like  

<span style="color:tomato"> *From general theoretical...* </span>
+ What is the genetic basis of local adapatation?
+ What are the environmental factors driving natural selection of genotypes?
+ Do genetic preseravtiona and conservation practices accurately caputre wild population diversity?

<span style="color:tomato"> *To more specific...* </span>
+ What are the genetic consequences of human-mediated out-crossing  
&nbsp;

## *Make the point that my current use of code is to **read** and **interpret** - i.e. **literacy***
  
Population genetics, maybe relative to many other biological sciences, has an extensive bioinformatic component that takes raw sequence reads and turns into individual genotypes.  

This workflow is very complex (<span style="color:green">*perhaps show some sort of general conceptual diagram of pop gen bioinformatic workflow*</span>).  

However, the general outline of this workflow is the same for nearly all pop gen studies (*with the details of certain steps getting tweaked, or certain steps added/removed*).  

Because of this, the workflows in our lab have become increasingly streamlined, with Trevor building on methods that Tom, Jahner, etc. have refined before him

<span style="color:green">*Bring up a raw version of Trevor jupyter notebook.  Show this and one more making point that there are **many** steps with mix of code languages, multiple packages, etc.  **BUT** this entire workflow could take you from point A to Z with a few clicks of button and some minor filename/directory changes.*</span>

## *Annotating code*

One of my current goals objectives is to took these workflows and understand what processes are occurring and why - *code comprehension rather than code writing*
